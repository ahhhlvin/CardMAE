Does not crash.
Does not hang - that is, there should be little to no delay visible to the user.
Does not fail when internet connection is slow/unavailable.
Have a consistent look and feel visually across the app.
Have consistent coding style across the source.
Have well-organized code that makes it easy to add new features.
Either be locked to one orientation or look great in both landscape and portrait.
Remember to use the software engineering practices we've developed this unit! Work on different branches for different features. Code review each other. Design APIs together. You can do it!

We will have demos in class on Thursday July 2nd. I will probably ask your team one or two technical questions based on your source.

We will also have demo rehearsals in class on Thursday June 30th. These are not optional, so prepare to be code complete by this date at the latest.
